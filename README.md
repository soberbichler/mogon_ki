# Notebooks to use with Mogon OnDemond

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks that are being used with Mogon OnDemand (https://docs.hpc.uni-mainz.de/blog/mogon-ondemand/), a web-based platform based on OpenOnDemand that simplifies access to MOGON NHR HPC resources.

The notebooks connect to local LLMs - saved at servers at the University of Mainz - via Ollama. Mogon OnDemand also provides options to connect to GUPs.
The notebooks are used to apply NLP-taks to digitized historical newspapers
